# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game is over if the snake hits the edges of the screen or collides with its own body.

## Installation

To run the game, first ensure that Pygame is installed. You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Run the code using the following command:

```bash
$python snake_game.py
```

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Halip26/snake-game.git

   cd snake-game
   ```

3. Make changes or add new features to the codebase on your local machine.

4. Stage and commit your changes using the command "git add " and then "git commit -m " in Git Bash.

5. Push your changes back to your forked repository on GitHub using the command "git push origin ".

6. Create a new pull request from your forked repository to the original repository by clicking on the "New pull request" button on the project's GitHub page.

7. Write a detailed description of your changes and why they're necessary, and then click on the "Create pull request" button.

8. Wait for the project maintainers to review your pull request, make any necessary changes, and then merge your changes into the main codebase.
